<h1 id="amerbrit" style="font-size:32px">American vs British English</h1>
<div align="center">
Colour - British english<br>
Color - American english
</div><br><br>
But why two spellings ?<br>
Well to know that we have to go back to olden times to 18th century Britain, before they decided how the heck you're supposed to spell things. Back then, you could write colour as color, culoure, colur, or even coolor.<br><br>
But by the time <b>Samuel Johnson</b> came to writing his famous dictionary, we'd settled on the spelling that we used today(colour). That was in 1755.<br><br>
Half a century later in the United States of America, fellow stern-faced dictionary peddler <b>Noah Webster</b> was coming up with a shiny new version of English to go with his shiny new nation that had just become independent from Britain. When he wrote his Compendious Dictionary of the English Language he made lots of little tweaks to make <b>American English different to British English</b>.
<br><br><br>One of the changes he made was to <b>get rid of any letters that he saw as unnecessary</b>. So when it came to the word 'color' he saw that "u" as far too much of a faff and dropped it. And that's why we have two different spellings of colour, labour, flavour, clamour, behavior, harbour...<br><br><br>

<h2 style="font-size:20px">Fan theories</h2>
<ul>
<li>At university (in the UK) one computer graphics professor told us that it takes more keypresses to spell the word the American way: 'c', 'o', 'l', 'o', 'u', 'r', backspace, backspace, 'r'.<br></li>
<li>America : « color, harbor, labor, behavior »<br>
England : « what are you doing, America? »<br>
America : « getting rid of u »<br><br><br><br><br><br><div align="center">1</div></li>
<li>Americans use "z" instead of "s" for words like "organize"... because typesetters found that "s" was used too much, whereas "z" was hardly used, so they replaced some "s" with "z".<br>
It makes sense if you could see actual "s" when being used in typesetting. They get damaged (filled with ink) and need to be replaced most frequently. So, if you replaced a few instances of "s" with "z", it extends the life of "s", that's all. Plus, it follows from the American's need to be different from the hated British.<br></li>
<li>There's a rumour that in a "queue" all the letters after Q are still waiting to be pronounced</li>

<h1 id="frenchist" style="font-size:32px">History of French words</h1>
<h3 style="float:right">(in english)</h3><br><br><br><br>
When we speak English we speak far more French than you might ever have realized. The language wouldn't be the same without it.<br><br><br>
You see when <b>William the Conqueror</b> crossed the channel (between france and england) in 1066 and conquered England, he <b>brought his language with him</b>. Old French was now the language of England's ruling class.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while the poor old Anglo-Saxons (cultural group who inhabited England in the Early Middle Ages) were  out toiling in the fields, the Normans were sat in their chateaux speaking Old French or what became <b>Anglo-Norman French</b> and that's why lots of words that we use in the fields of arts, government, chivalry and justice come from Old French. In fact all of those terms themselves come from French.<br><br><br>
One of the best examples of this haughty French influence in Modern English is with animals. Have you ever noticed how
when they're in the field they've got Germanic names like cow, sheep, pig and deer but as soon as we put them on a plate  ready to serve at a banquet they've got French names like beef, mutton, pork and venison. What does that tell you about who was doing the hard work and who was getting the benefits?<br><br><br>
Since the time of William the Conqueror, English has kept on taking on French words. Now French vocab makes up about <b>30% of the English</b> language.

<h1 id="silentletter" style="font-size:32px">3. Silent letters</h1>
Everybody (K)nows that English can be a nightmare to (w)rite. It seems like the spellings have been desi(g)ned to be difficult. I mean, who came up with this stuff, some (p)syc(h)o?<br><br><br>
Well actually all of these letters that are there but we don't pronounce them are still there for a reason. Let's go through these.<br><br><br>
<h2>Words beginning with kn, gn</h2>
Silent K appears at the start of quite a few English words like knot, knife, knees, knuckles, knob etc...
It also has an equally quiet friend called Silent G that you get at the start of gnat, gnaw and gnarly.<br><br>
So why are they even there? <br>They make no difference to the way in which we say those words. Well, the answer is history. All of those words come from Old English, which is being spoken about a thousand years ago. Back then, the G and the K were pronounced.<br><br>
But why are those G's and K's silent now?<br>
Well, at some point, we just stopped saying them. Call it laziness if you like but they just became a bit too much hassle, you k-now? But you know who didn't find it too much hard work? The speakers of England's long lost cousin, German. Here a knee is a "Knie", a knot is a "Knoten" and a gnome is a "Gnom".
through these.<br><br><br>
<h2>Debt, Receipt, Isle ...</h2>
Here, the silent letters are placed, though unnecessary and not present in their old french root words. But, they are present in their Latin root words. And, in renaissance, they just wanted to move to the latin roots to showcase some changes.
<h2 style="font-size:20px">Fan theories</h2>
<ul>
<li>SIGN is a sin without the "G".</li>
<li>There's a rumour that in a "queue" all the letters after Q are still waiting to be pronounced.</li>
<li>Putting a blank sheet of paper in an envelope and send it, could also be a silent letter.</li>
<li>We should normalise IPA</li>
